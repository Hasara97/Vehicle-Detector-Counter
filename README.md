# Vehicle-Detector-and-Counter
A vehicle detector and counter using Python, OpenCV and Cascade Classifiers. 

Code is written to detect only bikes (Two wheelers). However, you can detect busses,cars and even pedestrians using a different classifier.
All those Cascade Classifiers are also available in the Cascade folder.
